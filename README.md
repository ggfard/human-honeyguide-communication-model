# Human-honeyguide Communication modeling

This is a simulation of human-honeyguide communication, in which the bird guides the human to find the location of a honeybee hive. 

To make the model more data-driven, we are using experimental data from human and greater honeyguide calls during the hunt to extract some features to feed into our model. The experimental data of human grunts and human whistles  are taken from the supplementary material of this paper by Claire N. Spottiswoode et al: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh4129. The greater honeyguide calls are recorded from this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCoRLkKX6l8
